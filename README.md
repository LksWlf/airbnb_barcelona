# Airbnb Barcelona

## Introduction and Problem Description
As one of the most visited cities in Europe, Barcelona is particularly affected by the negative consequences of mass tourism. Particular attention is being paid to the increase in rents for residents, as well as a reduction in housing supply in general, as housing is being replaced by tourist use. As a consequence, Barcelona mayor Jaume Collboni announced plans to ban short term rentals in the city starting in November 2028.

In this context, I was curious to find out about the numbers behind Airbnb Listings in Barcelona, with Airbnb being one of the biggest and widely used short term rental platforms. I am particulary interest in questions like:

1. In which areas are most of Airbnb Listinings located?
2. What kind of Listinings are provided? Entire apartments or mostly private rooms in a shared flat?
3. How many hosts do actually have several listinings?

## Dataset
I found the data on Kaggle, an Online-Community for Machine Learning and Data Science (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zakariaeyoussefi/barcelona-airbnb-listings-inside-airbnb/data). The original dataset is provided from the website "Inside Airbnb" https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/. The aim of this project is to provide data about about Airbnb's impact on residential communities and cities.

## Method
First data loading and table creation: I have used MySQL to create the table and write the SQL queries. We then start with understanding our dataset and checking for missing values as well as outliers.
We use **Tableau** public to create a Dashboard and visualize our data and findings in different graphs.

## Result
The Tableau Dashboard 
Not possible to say how many private rooms are in a share flat with this dataset.
